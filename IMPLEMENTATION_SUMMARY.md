Perfect! I've successfully enhanced the admin products form with the following improvements:

## ✅ Completed Features:

### 1. **Multi-Step Form (6 Steps)**
- **Step 1:** Basic Information (name, SKU, descriptions, category, brand selection)
- **Step 2:** Pricing & Inventory (price, cost, stock management)  
- **Step 3:** Tire Specifications (tire-specific fields)
- **Step 4:** Physical Properties (weight, dimensions)
- **Step 5:** Product Images (drag & drop upload)
- **Step 6:** SEO & Meta Information

### 2. **localStorage Persistence**
- ✅ Auto-saves form data as user types
- ✅ Restores form state on page reload
- ✅ Shows "Auto-saved" indicator
- ✅ Clears storage on successful submission
- ✅ Preserves current step position

### 3. **Category & Brand Selection**
- ✅ Replaced ID inputs with proper dropdowns
- ✅ Real-time loading from API endpoints
- ✅ Created `/api/categories` and `/api/brands` endpoints
- ✅ Added React Query hooks for data fetching
- ✅ User-friendly name-based selection

### 4. **Enhanced UX Features**
- ✅ Progress indicator with percentage
- ✅ Step validation and navigation
- ✅ Visual step completion status
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- ✅ Form dirty state tracking
- ✅ Auto-save notifications

### 5. **Technical Improvements**

The form now provides a much better user experience with:
- **No data loss** due to localStorage persistence

Users can now start creating a product, navigate away, and return later to find their progress exactly where they left off!
